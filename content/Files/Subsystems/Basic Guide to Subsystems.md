Subsystems are the backbone of our robot's functionality, each managing a specific aspect of the robot's hardware. Below, you'll find detailed explanations and implementations for each of our key subsystems. Click on the links to explore how each subsystem is designed and how it contributes to the overall performance of our robot.

- [[Arm]]: Control mechanisms and sensors that manage the movement and positioning of the robot's arm.
- [[Elevator]]: How the elevator subsystem operates, including its motor control and feedback systems for lifting and lowering mechanisms.
- [[Intake]]: Handles the collection and handling of game pieces.
- [[Shooter]]: Responsible for launching game pieces into the desired location
- [[Drive]]: Responsible for the robot's movement and navigation through motors and encoders. Usually done with Swerve
