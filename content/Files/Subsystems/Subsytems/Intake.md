# Intake Subsystem Documentation

## Overview
The `Intake` subsystem controls the intake mechanism of the robot, which is responsible for collecting game pieces. The subsystem uses a single brushless motor, an encoder for feedback, and two beam break sensors to detect the presence of objects.

### Features:
- Single motor control for intake speed
- Beam break sensors for object detection
- Encoder feedback for motor velocity monitoring
- SmartDashboard integration for telemetry and tuning

---

## Code Overview

### Motor Initialization
The subsystem initializes a `CANSparkMax` motor to control the intake mechanism:

```java
intakeNeo1 = new CANSparkMax(id, MotorType.kBrushless);
intakeNeo1.setInverted(false);
intakeNeo1.setIdleMode(IdleMode.kBrake);
```

- **Motor** (`intakeNeo1`): Brushless motor that drives the intake mechanism.
- **Inverted**: The motor is not inverted, meaning it operates in its normal direction.
- **Idle Mode**: The motor is set to brake mode to stop when power is cut.

### Encoder Initialization
A relative encoder is attached to the motor to monitor its velocity:

```java
intakeEncoder = intakeNeo1.getEncoder();
SmartDashboard.putNumber("ProcessVariable", intakeEncoder.getVelocity());
```

This allows the motorâ€™s speed to be monitored and adjusted if needed.

## Object Detection

### Beam Break Sensors
Two `DigitalInput` beam break sensors are used to detect objects in the intake:

```java
private DigitalInput beamBreakOvershoot = new DigitalInput(1);
private DigitalInput beamBreakNote = new DigitalInput(2);
```

- **Beam Break 1 (Overshoot)**: Detects whether an object has fully passed through the intake.
- **Beam Break 2 (Note)**: Detects whether an object is currently being intaken.

These sensors are used to control the logic of whether an object is being collected or has passed through the intake.

### Object Detection Logic

- **`getOvershootBeam()`**: Returns the state of the overshoot sensor, which indicates whether the object has been fully collected.
- **`getNoteBeam()`**: Returns the state of the note sensor, which indicates whether the object is currently in the process of being intaken.

### Object State Methods

- **`getRing()`**: Returns whether the intake has an object (`hasRing` flag).
- **`ringTrue()`**: Sets the `hasRing` flag to `true`, indicating the presence of an object.
- **`ringFalse()`**: Sets the `hasRing` flag to `false`, indicating no object is present.

## Movement Control

### `move(double speed)`
Sets the intake motor speed, allowing for manual control of the intake mechanism:

```java
public void move(double speed) {
    intakeNeo1.set(speed);
}
```

### `stopIntake()`
Stops the intake motor by setting its speed to zero:

```java
public void stopIntake() {
    intakeNeo1.set(0);
}
```

These methods provide simple control for the intake mechanism, enabling the intake motor to run at a specific speed or stop completely.

---

## Telemetry

The subsystem uses the `SmartDashboard` to display telemetry data for debugging and tuning:

```java
SmartDashboard.putBoolean("intake//Beam Break Overshoot", beamBreakOvershoot.get());
SmartDashboard.putBoolean("intake//Beam Break Overshoot has Ring", hasRing);
SmartDashboard.putBoolean("intake//Beam Break Intaking", beamBreakNote.get());
```

- **Beam Break Overshoot**: Displays whether the overshoot beam is triggered.
- **Has Ring**: Displays whether the system has detected an object.
- **Beam Break Intaking**: Displays whether the intake is currently intaking an object.

---

## Periodic Functions

### `periodic()`
This method runs every scheduler cycle and updates the state of the sensors and SmartDashboard telemetry:

```java
@Override
public void periodic() {
    if (beamBreakOvershoot.get() == false) {
        ringTrue();
    } else { 
        ringFalse();
    }

    if (beamBreakNote.get() == false) {
        intakingRing = true;
    } else {
        intakingRing = false;
    }

    SmartDashboard.putBoolean("intake//Beam Break Overshoot", beamBreakOvershoot.get());
    SmartDashboard.putBoolean("intake//Beam Break Overshoot has Ring", hasRing);
    SmartDashboard.putBoolean("intake//Beam Break Intaking", beamBreakNote.get());
}
```

The `periodic()` method continually checks the state of the beam break sensors and updates the status of whether an object is detected or being intaken.

### `simulationPeriodic()`
This method is used when running simulations.

```java
@Override
public void simulationPeriodic() {
    // This method will be called once per scheduler run during simulation
}
```

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate additional logic for controlling the intake speed based on object detection.
- Use encoder feedback to implement speed control for more consistent intake performance.
- Further enhance the SmartDashboard telemetry with additional intake status information.

This documentation provides a clear explanation of the Intake subsystem, including its movement control, object detection via beam break sensors, and telemetry integration. It also suggests future enhancements for improving performance and control.
