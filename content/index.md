Welcome to the comprehensive guide on all the ins-and-outs you need for FRC programming, specifically tailored for Team VorTX 3735. This guide is designed to provide you with a detailed understanding of our programming practices, file structure, and the specific files and subsystems that make our robot function seamlessly. Whether you are a new member or an experienced programmer, this documentation will serve as your go-to resource for everything related to our team's codebase.

#### Website Overview

Our documentation website is organized to help you navigate through various aspects of our programming workflow efficiently. Hereâ€™s what you can expect to find:

1. **File Structure**
    
    - **[[File Structure]]**: An explanation of how our project is structured, helping you understand where each component of the code resides.
    - **Directories**: Details about the main directories such as `src`, `main`, `java`, and how they are organized to keep the code modular and maintainable.
2. **Key Files**
    
    - **[[RobotContainer.java]]**: This file acts as the central hub of our robot's code, managing subsystems, commands, and button bindings. Learn how this file integrates different components and orchestrates their interaction.
    - **[[Subsystems]]**: A deep dive into the various subsystems we use, such as the drivetrain, arm, and intake. Each subsystem is explained with details on its purpose, implementation, and how it interacts with other parts of the robot.
    - **[[Commands]]**: An explanation of the command-based programming structure we use, including examples of basic commands and more complex command groups.
3. **Advanced Features**
    
    - **[[AutoAim]]**: Explore the advanced functionality of our auto-aim system, which uses advanced physics and vision processing to automatically align the robot with targets. This section covers the algorithms, hardware integration, and troubleshooting tips.
    - **[[Autonomous]]**: Detailed information on how we program the autonomous phase of the competition, including path planning, motion profiling, and integrating sensor feedback to achieve precise movements.
4. **Best Practices**
    
    - **Coding Standards**: Guidelines on coding standards and practices to ensure our code is clean, efficient, and easy to understand.
    - **Version Control**: Instructions on using Git for version control, including branching strategies, commit messages, and collaboration tips.
    - **Testing and Debugging**: Techniques for testing and debugging your code, with tools and methods that help identify and resolve issues quickly.
5. **Resources and Support**
    
    - **Tutorials**: Step-by-step tutorials for beginners covering the basics of FRC programming.
    - **FAQ**: A frequently asked questions section to address common issues and provide quick solutions.
    - **Community Links**: Links to forums, documentation, and other resources where you can get help and learn more about FRC programming.

This guide is continuously updated to reflect the latest changes and improvements in our programming practices. This documentation outlines how VorTX 3735 approaches FRC programming and be well-equipped to contribute to our success in competitions.
